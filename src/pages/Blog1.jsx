                Ever thought how you think of random things at places zoning out into the empty spaces
                of your imagination. Yeah, that's you basically drifting away into the abyss without thinking of it and just 
                randomly keeping it into your subconcious until you eventually give in.
            </p>

            <p style={{ borderBottom: "1px solid black", paddingBottom: "15px" }}>
                Let's say you have been working hard for the past week and now you have been burnt out 
                due to certain other aspect of your life. You might notice that due to heavy scenarios like stress, work pressure and 
                conditions where the brain requires a high amount of throughput in real world are the time period around which you have these
                "zone outs" a lot.
                <br />
                There's something called as a DMN-Default Mode Network, which our brain activates to shift the focus from the current
                happening scenario to the fantasy dreamy world of thoughts. That's when these zone outs occur. People are present in the 
                real world but the things happening around them do not make any sense as they are only PHYSICALLY present.
                <br /><br />

                This somehow connects to another such topic which is solace of doing nothing. The things we do in life do not always mean something but 
                later at a time when we connect the dots we find out that those were things that were meant to happen.
                So sometimes when doing nothing also tends to lead to something happening, so the question is why do things in the first place if
                an event has to occur anyway.

                <br />
                Here comes the butterfly effect in context to the things I yapped till now, because small actions lead to bigger things in life.
                Remember how I said that soemtimes we tend to just stare at the abyss without any goal in mind and completely detached from
                the outer world. <br /><br />
                That stare is procrastination, a/c me, the things that can cure your procrastination are mainly the
                things that are out of your solace , mainly the things that have a  huge value in the long run but due to 
                the recent immaturities of hormonal disbalances which is mostly seen in adolescents, it leads to irrational decisions and 
                illogical explanations of certain scenrios that we feed to our subconcious.

                <h3 style={{ margin: "0 0 10px 0" }}>So what can we do ???</h3>
                <br />
                The only constant that stays is the constant of change and acceptance to the true nature of the current
                environment we are dealing with. Instead of staring in the abyss (Procrastinating) we can try to keep the things
                at their variable change (which again is the constant of change) and the base value they reflect at us.
                <br />
                So to keep things simple: Keep going, stop at points, analyze issues, procrastinate on solutions rather than
                the face value of solace of nothingness.
